EV Adoption Forecast Dashboard
An interactive web application that forecasts electric vehicle (EV) adoption trends at the county level using Machine Learning. Built as part of the Shell Green Project under Skill4Future by Shell & Edunet Foundation, this dashboard empowers users to visualize, predict, and explore the EV future of any region in the U.S.

Project Highlights
3-Year EV Forecast using historical data and ML
Interactive Map View of county-wise EV hotspots
Cumulative Trend Visualization of historical + forecast data
Scenario Simulations (What-if analysis)
Multi-County Comparison for broader insights
User Feedback Integration for iterative improvements

Features Overview
EV Forecast
Predict future EV count for any selected county for the next 3 years using historical patterns and engineered features.
Map View
Visualize the latest EV adoption by county across the U.S. using geolocation-based mapping (latitude and longitude).
Scenario Simulation
Modify internal assumptions (growth rate, incentives, charging infra) and observe simulated changes in future EV trends.
Compare Counties
Select up to 5 counties to analyze and compare EV growth and adoption side by side.
Feedback Form
Collect insights and suggestions from users directly within the app.
